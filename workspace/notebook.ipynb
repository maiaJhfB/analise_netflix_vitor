There are three sections - reading, math, and writing, each with a **maximum score of 800 points**. These tests are extremely important for students and colleges, as they play a pivotal role in the admissions process.\n\nAnalyzing the performance of schools is important for a variety of stakeholders, including policy and education professionals, researchers, government, and even parents considering which school their children should attend. \n\nYou have been provided with a dataset called `schools.csv`, which is previewed below.\n\nYou have been tasked with answering three key questions about New York City (NYC) public school SAT performance.","metadata":{},"id":"fe0ea788-58dd-459e-8976-fafdb5c05c6d","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# Re-run this cell \nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Read in the data\nschools = pd.read_csv(\"schools.csv\")\n\n# Preview the data\nschools.head()\n\n# Start coding here...\n\n#Â Which schools are best for math?\nbest_math_schools = schools[schools[\"average_math\"] >= 640][[\"school_name\", \"average_math\"]].sort_values(\"average_math\", ascending=False)\n\n# Calculate total_SAT per school\nschools[\"total_SAT\"] = schools[\"average_math\"] + schools[\"average_reading\"] + schools[\"average_writing\"]\n\n# Who are the top 10 performing schools?\ntop_10_schools = schools.sort_values(\"total_SAT\", ascending=False)[[\"school_name\", \"total_SAT\"]].head(10)\n\n# Which NYC borough has the highest standard deviation for total_SAT?\nboroughs = schools.groupby(\"borough\")[\"total_SAT\"].agg([\"count\", \"mean\", \"std\"]).round(2)\n\n# Filter for max std and make borough a column\nlargest_std_dev = boroughs[boroughs[\"std\"] == boroughs[\"std\"].max()]\n\n# Rename the columns for clarity\nlargest_std_dev = largest_std_dev.rename(columns={\"count\": \"num_schools\", \"mean\": \"average_SAT\", \"std\": \"std_SAT\"})\n\n# Optional: Move borough from index to column\nlargest_std_dev.reset_index(inplace=True)","metadata":{"id":"bA5ajAmk7XH6","executionTime":51,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Re-run this cell \nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Read in the data\nschools = pd.read_csv(\"schools.csv\")\n\n# Preview the data\nschools.head()\n\n# Start coding here...\nbest_math_school = schools.groupby(\"school_name\")[\"average_math\"].max()\nschools['total_SAT'] = schools['average_math'] + schools['average_reading'] + schools['average_writing']\ntop_10_schools = schools.pivot_table(values='total_SAT',index='school_name')\ntop_10_schools.head(10)","executionCancelledAt":null,"lastExecutedAt":1740426022316,"lastScheduledRunId":null,"outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":550,"type":"dataFrame","tableState":{"quickFilterText":"","customFilter":{"const":{"type":"boolean","valid":true,"value":true},"id":"ab1321af-09fd-4b56-b4d6-7e75ee92bb89","nodeType":"const"},"sort":{"sortModel":[{"colId":"average_math","sort":"desc"}]}}}},"collapsed":true,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":true,"source_hidden":false},"lastExecutedByKernel":"7409028b-7bf0-4b85-86ac-a1d321c23606"},"id":"d0eb4f16-5a99-460d-a5ba-706b7ef0bbe7","cell_type":"code","execution_count":12,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"application/com.datacamp.data-table.v2+json":{"table":{"schema":{"fields":[{"name":"school_name","type":"string"},{"name":"total_SAT","type":"integer"}],"primaryKey":["school_name"],"pandas_version":"1.4.0"},"data":{"school_name":["A.
